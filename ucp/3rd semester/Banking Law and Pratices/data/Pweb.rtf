\par Sp. and Port- poder, h- podere; or rather the same word varied in orthography. The Latin has posse, possum, potes, potentia. The primary sense of the verb is to strain, or ex- ert force.]
\par I- In a philosophical sense, the faculty of doing or performing any thing; the faculty of
 moving or of producing a ehange in something; ability or strength. A man raises his hand by his own power, or by power moves another body. The exertion of power proceeds from the will, and in strictness, no being destitute of will or intelligence, can ex
ert power. Power in man is active or speculative. Active power Li that - which moves the body; speculative power is that by which we see, judge, remember, or in general, by which we think.
\par Power may exist without exertion- We have power to speak when we are
 silent- Locke. Reid- Power has been distinguished also into active and passive, the power of doing or snoring, and the power of remit-Mg impressions or of suffering. In strictness, passive power is an absurdity in terms. To say that gold has a power to b
e melted, is improper language, yet for want of a more ap- propriate word, power is often used in a passive sense, and is considered as two-fold; viz- as able to make or able to
\par receive any change.\tab Cyc.
\par 2. Force; animal strength; 'as, the power of the arm, exerted in lifting, throwing or holding.
\par 3. Force; strength; energy; as, the power of the mind, of the imagination, of the fancy. He has not powers of genius adcquate to the work.
\par 4. Faculty of the mind, as manifested by a particular mode of operation; as, the pawer of thinking, comparing and judging; the reasoning powers.
\par 5. Ability, natural or moral. We say, a man has the power of doing good; his property gives him the power of relieving the distressed; or, he has the power to persuade others to do good; 
or, it is not in his power to pay his debts. The tuoral power of man is also his power of judging or discerning in moral subjects.
\par 6. In mechanics, that which produces motion or force, or which may be applied to produce it- Thus the inclined plane is calle
d a inechanical power, as it produces motion, although this in reality depends on gravity. The wheel and axle, and the lever, are mechanical powers, as they may be applied to produce force. These powers are also called _forces, and they arc of two kinds, 
moving power, and sustaining power.
\par T. Force. The great power of the screw is of extensive nee in eompression. The power of steam is iinmense.
\par 8. That quality in any natural body which produces a change or makes an impression on another body; as, the power of medicine; the power of heat; the power of sound.
\par 9. Force; strength; momentum; as, the power of the wind, 'which propels a ship or overturns a building.
\par 10. Influence; that which may move the mind; as, the power of arguments or of persuasion.
\par II. Comman
d; the right of governing, or actual government; dominion; rule; sway; authonty-; A large portion of Asia is under the power of the Russian emperor. The power of the British monarch is limited by law. The powers of government are legislative, executive, j

\par 1. A peculiar quality of any thing; that which is inherent in a subject, or naturalfy essential to it; called by logicians an essenlial mode. Thus color is a property of light; exteasion and fignre are properties of bodies.

\par 3. Quality; disposition.
\par It is the property of on old sinner to find delight in review- ing his own villainies in others.\tab Soulh.
\par 4. The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying and disposing of a thing; ownership. In the beginning of the world, the Creator gave to man dominion over the ea
rth, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air, and over every living thing. This is the foundation of man's property in the earth and in all its productions- Prior occupancy of land and of wild animals gives to tho possessor the property of them.
 
The labor of inventing, making or producing any thing constitutes one of the highest and most indefeasible titles to property. Property is also acquired by inheritance, by gift or by purchase. Property is sometimes held in common, yet each man's right to 
his share in common land or stock is exclusively his own- One man may have the property of the soil, aud another the right of use, by prescription or by purchase.
\par 5. Possession held in one's own right.\tab Dryden.

\par Literary property, the exclusive right of printing, publishing and making profit by one's own writings- No right or title to a thing can be so perfect as that which is created by a

\par s own labor and invention. The exclusive right of a man to his literary productions, and to the use of them for his own profit, is entire and perfect, as the faculties em-
 ployed and labor bestowed are entirely and perfectly his ] own. On what principle then can a legislaturo or a court determine that an author can enjoy only a tfinporary prop- erty in his own productions ? If a man's right to his own productions in writin
g
, is as perfect as to the productions of his farm or his shop, how can the former be abridged or lim- ited, while the latter is held without limitation ? Why do the produclians of manual labor rank higher in the scale of 1 rights or property, than the pro

\par 2. Proportion is the sameness or likeness of two such relations. Thus 5 is to 10, as 8 to 16, or A. is to B., as C- is to D.; that is, 5 bears the samo rela- tion to 10, as 8 does to 16. Hence wo say, such numbers
