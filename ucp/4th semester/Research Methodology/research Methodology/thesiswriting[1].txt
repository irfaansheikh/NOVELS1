.(5) Summary 
.Part 2: The Examiner’s View

What is a thesis? 
.An argument 
.An exposition of an original piece of research 
.The product of an apprenticeship 
.Probably the largest (most self-indulgent) piece of 
work you’ll ever do 
.Something that could be published: 
.E.g. at least one paper in a scholarly journal 
.but you will probably never publish the whole thesis 
“A thesis for the PhD must form a distinctive contribution to the knowledgeof the subject and afford evidence of originality shown by the discovery ofnew facts and/or by the exercise of independent critical power.” 
(University of London regulations)

Examination Issues 
.Your examiners need to appreciate your research: 
.Choose your examiners well 
.Target your thesis at them 
.Keep abreast of their work 
.Talk to them regularly 
.Ask around about what is the norm for your university 
.E.g. at U of T, it is normal to interact regularly with your thesis committee 
.Your examiners need to be told about your research: 
.If it’s not in your thesis, they won’t find out about it 
.No matter how good your research is, you MUST write a good thesis

How do I get started? 
.Do this today: 
.Decide your title 
.Write your title page 
.Start a binder 
.(Look at some theses in your area) 
.Plan your argument… 
.You can change things later 
.But you can’t change it unless you have something to change!

For example: 
Look, I’ve just 
done 1/126 
of the task! 
This changed 
a few times… 
I just copied 
this format 
from another 
thesis 
Okay, so this 
wasn’t my 
first choice…

Plan Your Argument 
One sentence for each:ExampleIntroduction(area of study)
“The success of a software development project depends oncapturing stakeholders’ needs in a specification ...
The problem(that I tackle)
“However, specifications often reflect the analyst’s own bias,
rather than the inputs of the many different stakeholders…
What the literature saysabout this problem“Current methods described in the literature fail to addressidentification and integration of multiple views.
How I tackle this problem“By treating the specification activity as a dialogue betweenstakeholders, we can model each perspective separately.
How I implement mysolution“We provide a set of tools for exploring disagreement betweenperspectives, and use these tools as the basis for a computer-
supported negotiation process.
The result“This approach is shown to significantly improve traceability andvalidity of specifications and overall stakeholder satisfaction.”

Plan your thesis 
.Convert this argument into a chapter outline 
.At least one chapter per sentence 
....maybe more than one for some sentences 
.Start a binder with a division for each chapter 
.Collect material in this binder 
.Set out clearly what each chapter should say 
.Don’t be afraid to change your mind 
.As you write the thesis, your ideas will evolve 
.Don’t wait for them to stop evolving: 
.It’s much easier to change an outline that you’ve written down than one you 
haven’t.

evolve as you proceed with 
the research 
.…and you may find that exactly six 
chapters doesn’t quite work for you…

Don’t omit any of these: 
Title (and title page) -conveys a message 
Abstract -for the librarian 
Contents Listing -shows the right things are there 
Acknowledgements -get your supervisor on your side! 
Introduction -says “I am going to look at the following things”. 
Review of Previous Work -show you know the subject 
Philosophy of Approach -show you can pick out important ideas succinctly 
Plan of Attack -show you approached the problem in a systematic way 
Description of the work -details, so that others can follow what you did 
Critical analysis of the results -show you know its limitations 
Future Work -show you know what’s missing 
Conclusions -repetition of the intro, but with reference to the detail. 
References -Cover the field; examiners will look for the key references 
Appendices -Nitty Gritty details that would clutter your eloquent description

Say everything thrice 
.In the thesis as a whole: 
.Within each chapter / section 
.Within each paragraph… 
.Each paragraph describes a single idea 
.The first sentence introduces the idea (linking it with the previous one) 
.The last sentence concludes the idea (linking it with the next one) 
.But it’s not repetition, it’s linking and rationale. 
.If you do it right, the reader won’t notice any repetition

Bibliography 
.Keep a database of complete references 
.Use a consistent citation style 
.Use a tool 
.Bibtex, Refer, Endnote, ProCite, or whatever. 
.Attention to detail is important 
.Get the spellings right 
.Keep complete references 
.page numbers, volume numbers, editors names, locations and dates for conference 
proceedings, etc. 
.Find out what the local rules are for citation style 
.If there are no local rules, use [Author, Year] format 
.This improves readability by saving the reader flicking to the back 
.Assume the reader is familiar with the main references 
.But that doesn’t mean you should skip them!

How do I get finished? 
Answer: by not getting stuck. 
You’ve written most of it ... 
... but for the bits you’re avoiding ... 
... you keep rewriting other bits ... 
... doing more reading ... 
... tinkering with the layout ... 
... seeking cute quotations ... 
Q: Why are you stuck? 
A: Because you’ve set yourself too hard a task. 
.Don’t be afraid to change your plan if it proves too hard. 
.Be savage in cutting irrelevant bits. 
.Learn how to notice symptoms of “being stuck”, and ask for help…

Reviewing 
.Get other people to read your drafts 
.Peers will give friendly comments (and may have the most time!) 
.Supervisor will steer you 
.Other academics will spot things your supervisor has missed. 
.Above all: 
.…get the bugs out before the examiners see it.

The Examiner’s View 
.Uh oh, not another thesis to read... 
.Your examiners are busy people 
.Examining theses is a chore, but: 
.“It might help me keep up to date with an area of research” 
.“It might inspire me” 
.“I might learn something” 
.“I might gain a new colleague” 
.Note: the reading will be done in trains, planes, and 
departmental meetings!

Examiner’s first question 
.What’s this one about? 
Examiners have little time available, so they want to extract the most juice in 
the shortest time: 
.This may be enough to decide whether it’s worth a PhD. 
.Then: 
1) What questions now spring to mind? 
2) ...read through... 
3) Were the questions answered? 
abstract bibliography conclusions contents listing 
Typical scanning order of a new thesis: 
What’s it 
about? 
Does it cite 
the right things? 
Has it been 
published already? 
What was 
achieved? 
do I believe it? 
Are all the 
pieces there? 
Is the 
argument clear?

Has it been published already? 
.Peer-review publications are crucial 
.The research community’s most important validation criteria 
.Sure-fire recipe for success: 
.Identify the top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in your area 
.Ask the experts to help you identify these 
.Concentrate on conferences -faster turn-around 
.Publish your research at them 
.Plan to have pieces of work ready for each conference submission deadline 
.Always take the reviewers comments seriously 
.If they didn’t understand your work, it’s your fault, not theirs! 
.If you can’t convince the reviewers, you won’t convince your examiners. 
.If you’ve published in the right places… 
.…you have nothing more to worry about 
.Your examiners cannot ignore the outcome of the peer-review process 
.(Unless you picked wacko examiners … see slide 4)

Corrections 
.“Now there must be some corrections…” 
.Some examiners don’t feel they’ve done the job unless they find some 
corrections to do. 
.Typical corrections 
.Typographical / grammatical errors 
.Poor presentation 
.Missing statements / references 
.(Superfluous / redundant statements) 
.Missing pieces of work 
.Whole sections missing … for example: 
.research questions 
.critical review of literature 
.research methodology 
.presentation of results 
.validation of results 
.discussion and conclusions

Thesis defense 
.“Let’s see, what can I ask the candidate?” 
.The examiners may have decided before the exam whether to pass you. 
.Defense, oral, viva, exam, ... 
.viva = “viva voce” = “lively discussion” 
.The exam is to check it’s your work... 
.Talk fluently about the work; 
.show you’ve thought about it (which you have!). 
.This is easy 
.after all you’ve spent four+ years talking about it! 
....and a chance to clarify things that aren’t clear in 
the thesis. 
.These are areas where corrections are likely.
