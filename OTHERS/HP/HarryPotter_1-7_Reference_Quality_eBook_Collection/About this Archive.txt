The PDF's have been encrypted but can be printed at full quality and all text and graphics can be copied but the pages can't be deleted or re-arranged.
This also stops the Metadata being changed easily.

The RTF's are exactly the same text as the PDF's with inverted comma's having spaces between so - " ' and ' "
and ellipsis replacing spaced full stops. Graphics have been replaced with the corresponding text.
Use these files to make your own ebook versions (LIT, PDB, LRF, etc.)

Scanned in the dark by BeB for everyone who has purchased the book and laments the lack of any eBook releases by the Author.
